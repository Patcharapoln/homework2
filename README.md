## Why simple fibonacci method is slower than use helper method ? <br>
* Because simple fibonacci method need to call recursive for 2 times. So it make Big O of this method be O(2^n) but if we use
helper method it make Big O of this method be O(n). So that make use helper method are faster than simple one.
